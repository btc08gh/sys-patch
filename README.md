# sys-patch

A script-like system module that patches **fs**, **es**, **ldr**, **nifm** and **nim** on boot.

---

## Config

**sys-patch** features a simple config. This can be manually edited or updated using the overlay.

The configuration file can be found in `/config/sys-patch/config.ini`. The file is generated once the module is ran for the first time.

```ini
[options]
patch_sysmmc=1   ; 1=(default) patch sysmmc, 0=don't patch sysmmc
patch_emummc=1   ; 1=(default) patch emummc, 0=don't patch emummc
enable_logging=1 ; 1=(default) output /config/sys-patch/log.ini 0=no log
version_skip=1   ; 1=(default) skips out of date patterns, 0=search all patterns
```

---

## Overlay

The overlay can be used to change the config options and to see what patches are applied.

- Unpatched means the patch wasn't applied (likely not found).
- Patched (green) means it was patched by sys-patch.
- Patched (yellow) means it was already patched, likely by sigpatches or a custom Atmosphere build.

## Building

### prerequisites
- Install [devkitpro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started)
- Run the following:
  ```sh
  git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ITotalJustice/sys-patch.git
  cd ./sys-patch
  make
  ```

The output of `out/` can be copied to your SD card.
To activate the sys-module, reboot your switch, or, use [sysmodules overlay](https://github.com/WerWolv/ovl-sysmodules/releases/latest) with the accompanying overlay to activate it.

## What is being patched?

Here's a quick run down of what's being patched:

- **fs** and **es** need new patches after every new firmware version.
- **ldr** needs new patches after every new [Atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere/) release.
- **nifm** ctest patch allows the device to connect to a network without needing to make a connection to a server
- **nim** patches to the ssl function call within nim that queries "https://api.hac.%.ctest.srv.nintendo.net/v1/time", and crashes the console if console ssl certificate is not intact. This patch instead makes the console not crash.

The patches are applied on boot. Once done, the sys-module stops running.
The memory footprint *(16kib)* and the binary size *(~50kib)* are both very small.

## FAQ:

### If I am using sigpatches already, is there any point in using this?

Yes, in 3 situations.

1. A new **ldr** patch needs to be created after every Atmosphere update. Sometimes, a new silent Atmosphere update is released. This tool will always patch **ldr** without having to update patches.

2. Building Atmosphere from src will require you to generate a new **ldr** patch for that custom built Atmosphere. This is easy enough due to the public scripts / tools that exist out there, however this will always be able to patch **ldr**.

3.  If you forget to update your patches when you update your firmware / Atmosphere, this sys-module should be able to patch everything. So it can be used as a fall back.

### Does this mean that I should stop downloading / using sigpatches?

No, I would personally recommend continuing to use sigpatches. Reason being is that should this tool ever break, i likely wont be quick to fix it.
